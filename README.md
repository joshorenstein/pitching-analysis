# Generalized Additive Model 
1) Uses pitch tracking data that predicts expected swinging strike rate based on pitch tracking data. <br/>
2) Fastball/Sinker models includes pitch velo, release point, spin rate, spin direction, break and plate location  <br/>
3) Breaking ball and offspeed models includes pitch velo, release point, spin rate, spin direction, break, plate location, and relative horizontal break and velo compared to fastball <br/>
4) This model will be updated to include command and batted ball data to create a more complete profile
